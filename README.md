# notes-app-js

This app is a Notes App that allows users to create, edit, and manage their notes efficiently. Users can add new notes, update their content in real-time, and delete notes when they are no longer needed. Each note is stored in the browser's local storage as a key-value pair, ensuring that the notes persist even after the page is refreshed.

The app features a clean, intuitive interface with a content-editable area for easy note-taking and editing. The use of local storage ensures that all changes are saved automatically, providing a seamless note-keeping experience.
